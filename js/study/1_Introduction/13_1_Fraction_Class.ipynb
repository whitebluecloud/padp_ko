For example,\n\ncreates an object called myfraction representing the fraction 35 (three-fifths). \n[Figure 5](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/fraction1.png) shows this object as it is now implemented.\n\nThe next thing we need to do is implement the behavior that the abstract data type requires. \nTo begin, consider what happens when we try to print a Fraction object.\n\nThe fraction object, myf, does not know how to respond to this request to print. \nThe print function requires that the object convert itself into a string so that the string can be written to the output. \nThe only choice myf has is to show the actual reference that is stored in the variable (the address itself). \nThis is not what we want.\n\nThere are two ways we can solve this problem. \nOne is to define a method called show that will allow the Fraction object to print itself as a string. \nWe can implement this method as shown in Listing 3. \nIf we create a Fraction object as before, we can ask it to show itself, \nin other words, print itself in the proper format. Unfortunately, this does not work in general. \nIn order to make printing work properly, we need to tell the Fraction class how to convert itself into a string. \nThis is what the print function needs in order to do its job.\n\nListing 3\n\nIn Python, all classes have a set of standard methods that are provided but may not work properly. \nOne of these, __str__, is the method to convert an object into a string. \nThe default implementation for this method is to return the instance address string as we have already seen. \nWhat we need to do is provide a “better” implementation for this method. \nWe will say that this implementation overrides the previous one, or that it redefines the method’s behavior.\n\nTo do this, we simply define a method with the name __str__ and give it a new implementation as shown in Listing 4. \nThis definition does not need any other information except the special parameter self. \nIn turn, the method will build a string representation by converting each piece of internal state data to a string and then placing a / character in between the strings using string concatenation. \nThe resulting string will be returned any time a Fraction object is asked to convert itself to a string. \nNotice the various ways that this function is used.\n\nListing 4\n\nWe can override many other methods for our new Fraction class. \nSome of the most important of these are the basic arithmetic operations. \nWe would like to be able to create two Fraction objects and then add them together using the standard “+” notation. \nAt this point, if we try to add two fractions, we get the following:\n\nIf you look closely at the error, you see that the problem is that the “+” operator does not understand the Fraction operands.\n\nWe can fix this by providing the Fraction class with a method that overrides the addition method. \nIn Python, this method is called __add__ and it requires two parameters. \nThe first, self, is always needed, and the second represents the other operand in the expression. For example,\n\nwould ask the Fraction object f1 to add the Fraction object f2 to itself. \nThis can be written in the standard notation, f1+f2.\n\nTwo fractions must have the same denominator to be added. \nThe easiest way to make sure they have the same denominator is to simply use the product of the two denominators as a common denominator so that ab+cd\u003dadbd+cbbd\u003dad+cbbd The implementation is shown in Listing 5. The addition function returns a new Fraction object with the numerator and denominator of the sum. \nWe can use this method by writing a standard arithmetic expression involving fractions, assigning the result of the addition, and then printing our result.\n\nListing 5\n\nThe addition method works as we desire, but one thing could be better. \nNote that 6/8 is the correct result (14+12) but that it is not in the “lowest terms” representation. The best representation would be 3/4. \nIn order to be sure that our results are always in the lowest terms, we need a helper function that knows how to reduce fractions. \nThis function will need to look for the greatest common divisor, or GCD. \nWe can then divide the numerator and the denominator by the GCD and the result will be reduced to lowest terms.\n\nThe best-known algorithm for finding a greatest common divisor is Euclid’s Algorithm, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8. \nEuclid’s Algorithm states that the greatest common divisor of two integers m and n is n if n divides m evenly. \nHowever, if n does not divide m evenly, then the answer is the greatest common divisor of n and the remainder of m divided by n. \nWe will simply provide an iterative implementation here (see ActiveCode 1). Note that this implementation of the GCD algorithm only works when the denominator is positive. \nThis is acceptable for our fraction class because we have said that a negative fraction will be represented by a negative numerator.\n\nNow we can use this function to help reduce any fraction. \nTo put a fraction in lowest terms, we will divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. \nSo, for the fraction 6/8, the greatest common divisor is 2. Dividing the top and the bottom by 2 creates a new fraction, 3/4 (see Listing 6).\n\nListing 6\n\n\nOur Fraction object now has two very useful methods and looks like [Figure 6](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/fraction2.png). \nAn additional group of methods that we need to include in our example Fraction class will allow two fractions to compare themselves to one another. \nAssume we have two Fraction objects, f1 and f2. f1\u003d\u003df2 will only be True if they are references to the same object. \nTwo different objects with the same numerators and denominators would not be equal under this implementation. This is called shallow equality (see [Figure 7](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/fraction3.png)).\n\nWe can create deep equality (see [Figure 7](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/fraction3.png))–equality by the same value, not the same reference–by overriding the __eq__ method. \nThe __eq__ method is another standard method available in any class. \nThe __eq__ method compares two objects and returns True if their values are the same, False otherwise.\n\nIn the Fraction class, we can implement the __eq__ method by again putting the two fractions in common terms and then comparing the numerators (see Listing 7). \nIt is important to note that there are other relational operators that can be overridden. \nFor example, the __le__ method provides the less than or equal functionality.\n\nListing 7\n\nThe complete Fraction class, up to this point, is shown in ActiveCode 2. \nWe leave the remaining arithmetic and relational methods as exercises.\n\nSelf Check\n\nTo make sure you understand how operators are implemented in Python classes, \nand how to properly write methods, write some methods to implement *, /, and - . Also implement comparison operators \u003e and \u003c\n"
