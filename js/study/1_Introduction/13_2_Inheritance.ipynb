Similarly, \nPython child classes can inherit characteristic data and behavior from a parent class. \nThese classes are often referred to as subclasses and superclasses.\n\n[Figure 8](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/inheritance1.png) shows the built-in Python collections and their relationships to one another. \nWe call a relationship structure such as this an inheritance hierarchy. For example, the list is a child of the sequential collection. \nIn this case, we call the list the child and the sequence the parent (or subclass list and superclass sequence). \nThis is often referred to as an IS-A Relationship (the list IS-A sequential collection). \nThis implies that lists inherit important characteristics from sequences, namely the ordering of the underlying data and operations such as concatenation, repetition, and indexing.\n\nLists, tuples, and strings are all types of sequential collections. \nThey all inherit common data organization and operations. \nHowever, each of them is distinct based on whether the data is homogeneous and whether the collection is immutable. \nThe children all gain from their parents but distinguish themselves by adding additional characteristics.\n\nBy organizing classes in this hierarchical fashion, \nobject-oriented programming languages allow previously written code to be extended to meet the needs of a new situation. \nIn addition, by organizing data in this hierarchical manner, we can better understand the relationships that exist. \nWe can be more efficient in building our abstract representations.\n\nTo explore this idea further, we will construct a simulation, an application to simulate digital circuits. \nThe basic building block for this simulation will be the logic gate. \nThese electronic switches represent boolean algebra relationships between their input and their output. \nIn general, gates have a single output line. The value of the output is dependent on the values given on the input lines.\n\nAND gates have two input lines, each of which can be either 0 or 1 (representing False or True, repectively). \nIf both of the input lines have the value 1, the resulting output is 1. \nHowever, if either or both of the input lines is 0, the result is 0. OR gates also have two input lines and produce a 1 if one or both of the input values is a 1. \nIn the case where both input lines are 0, the result is 0.\n\nNOT gates differ from the other two gates in that they only have a single input line. \nThe output value is simply the opposite of the input value. If 0 appears on the input, 1 is produced on the output. \nSimilarly, 1 produces 0. [Figure 9](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/truthtable.png) shows how each of these gates is typically represented. \nEach gate also has a truth table of values showing the input-to-output mapping that is performed by the gate.\n\nBy combining these gates in various patterns and then applying a set of input values, \nwe can build circuits that have logical functions. \n[Figure 10](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/circuit1.png) shows a circuit consisting of two AND gates, one OR gate, and a single NOT gate. \nThe output lines from the two AND gates feed directly into the OR gate, and the resulting output from the OR gate is given to the NOT gate. \nIf we apply a set of input values to the four input lines (two for each AND gate), the values are processed and a result appears at the output of the NOT gate.\n[Figure 10](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/circuit1.png) also shows an example with values.\n\nIn order to implement a circuit, we will first build a representation for logic gates. \nLogic gates are easily organized into a class inheritance hierarchy as shown in [Figure 11](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/_images/gates.png). \nAt the top of the hierarchy, the LogicGate class represents the most general characteristics of logic gates: namely, a label for the gate and an output line. \nThe next level of subclasses breaks the logic gates into two families, those that have one input line and those that have two. \nBelow that, the specific logic functions of each appear.\n\nWe can now start to implement the classes by starting with the most general, LogicGate. \nAs noted earlier, each gate has a label for identification and a single output line. \nIn addition, we need methods to allow a user of a gate to ask the gate for its label.\n\nThe other behavior that every logic gate needs is the ability to know its output value. \nThis will require that the gate perform the appropriate logic based on the current input. \nIn order to produce output, the gate needs to know specifically what that logic is. \nThis means calling a method to perform the logic computation. \nThe complete class is shown in Listing 8.\n\nListing 8\n\nAt this point, we will not implement the performGateLogic function. \nThe reason for this is that we do not know how each gate will perform its own logic operation. \nThose details will be included by each individual gate that is added to the hierarchy. \nThis is a very powerful idea in object-oriented programming. We are writing a method that will use code that does not exist yet. \nThe parameter self is a reference to the actual gate object invoking the method. \nAny new logic gate that gets added to the hierarchy will simply need to implement the performGateLogic function and it will be used at the appropriate time. \nOnce done, the gate can provide its output value. \nThis ability to extend a hierarchy that currently exists and provide the specific functions that the hierarchy needs to use the new class is extremely important for reusing existing code.\n\nWe categorized the logic gates based on the number of input lines. \nThe AND gate has two input lines. \nThe OR gate also has two input lines. NOT gates have one input line. \nThe BinaryGate class will be a subclass of LogicGate and will add two input lines. \nThe UnaryGate class will also subclass LogicGate but will have only a single input line. \nIn computer circuit design, these lines are sometimes called “pins” so we will use that terminology in our implementation.\n\nListing 9 \n\nListing 10 \n\nListing 9 and Listing 10 implement these two classes. \nThe constructors in both of these classes start with an explicit call to the constructor of the parent class using the parent’s __init__ method. \nWhen creating an instance of the BinaryGate class, we first want to initialize any data items that are inherited from LogicGate. \nIn this case, that means the label for the gate. The constructor then goes on to add the two input lines (pinA and pinB). \nThis is a very common pattern that you should always use when building class hierarchies. \nChild class constructors need to call parent class constructors and then move on to their own distinguishing data.\n\nPython also has a function called super which can be used in place of explicitly naming the parent class. \nThis is a more general mechanism, and is widely used, especially when a class has more than one parent. \nBut, this is not something we are going to discuss in this introduction. \nFor example in our example above LogicGate.__init__(self,n) could be replaced with super(UnaryGate,self).__init__(n).\n\nThe only behavior that the BinaryGate class adds is the ability to get the values from the two input lines. \nSince these values come from some external place, we will simply ask the user via an input statement to provide them. \nThe same implementation occurs for the UnaryGate class except that there is only one input line.\n\nNow that we have a general class for gates depending on the number of input lines, we can build specific gates that have unique behavior. \nFor example, the AndGate class will be a subclass of BinaryGate since AND gates have two input lines. \nAs before, the first line of the constructor calls upon the parent class constructor (BinaryGate), which in turn calls its parent class constructor (LogicGate). \nNote that the AndGate class does not provide any new data since it inherits two input lines, one output line, and a label.\n\nListing 11\n\nThe only thing AndGate needs to add is the specific behavior that performs the boolean operation that was described earlier. \nThis is the place where we can provide the performGateLogic method. \nFor an AND gate, this method first must get the two input values and then only return 1 if both input values are 1. \nThe complete class is shown in Listing 11.\n\n We can show the AndGate class in action by creating an instance and asking it to compute its output. \n The following session shows an AndGate object, g1, that has an internal label \"G1\". \n When we invoke the getOutput method, the object must first call its performGateLogic method which in turn queries the two input lines. \n Once the values are provided, the correct output is shown.\n \n The same development can be done for OR gates and NOT gates. \n The OrGate class will also be a subclass of BinaryGate and the NotGate class will extend the UnaryGate class. \n Both of these classes will need to provide their own performGateLogic functions, as this is their specific behavior.\n\nWe can use a single gate by first constructing an instance of one of the gate classes and then asking the gate for its output (which will in turn need inputs to be provided). For example:\n\nNow that we have the basic gates working, we can turn our attention to building circuits. \nIn order to create a circuit, we need to connect gates together, the output of one flowing into the input of another. \nTo do this, we will implement a new class called Connector.\n\nThe Connector class will not reside in the gate hierarchy. \nIt will, however, use the gate hierarchy in that each connector will have two gates, one on either end (see Figure 12). \nThis relationship is very important in object-oriented programming. \nIt is called the HAS-A Relationship. \nRecall earlier that we used the phrase “IS-A Relationship” to say that a child class is related to a parent class, for example UnaryGate IS-A LogicGate.\n\nNow, with the Connector class, we say that a Connector HAS-A LogicGate meaning that connectors will have instances of the LogicGate class within them but are not part of the hierarchy. \nWhen designing classes, it is very important to distinguish between those that have the IS-A relationship (which requires inheritance) and those that have HAS-A relationships (with no inheritance).\n\nListing 12 shows the Connector class. \nThe two gate instances within each connector object will be referred to as the fromgate and the togate, recognizing that data values will “flow” from the output of one gate into an input line of the next. \nThe call to setNextPin is very important for making connections (see Listing 13). \nWe need to add this method to our gate classes so that each togate can choose the proper input line for the connection.\n\nListing 12\n\nIn the BinaryGate class, for gates with two possible input lines, the connector must be connected to only one line. \nIf both of them are available, we will choose pinA by default. \nIf pinA is already connected, then we will choose pinB. \nIt is not possible to connect to a gate with no available input lines.\n\nListing 13\n\nNow it is possible to get input from two places:\nexternally, as before, and from the output of a gate that is connected to that input line. \nThis requires a change to the getPinA and getPinB methods (see Listing 14). \nIf the input line is not connected to anything (None), then ask the user externally as before. \nHowever, if there is a connection, the connection is accessed and fromgate’s output value is retrieved. \nThis in turn causes that gate to process its logic. \nThis continues until all input is available and the final output value becomes the required input for the gate in question. \nIn a sense, the circuit works backwards to find the input necessary to finally produce output.\n\nListing 14\n\nThe following fragment constructs the circuit shown earlier in the section:\n\nThe outputs from the two AND gates (g1 and g2) are connected to the OR gate (g3) and that output is connected to the NOT gate (g4). \nThe output from the NOT gate is the output of the entire circuit. For example:\n\nTry it yourself using ActiveCode 4.\n\nSelf Check\nCreate a two new gate classes, one called NorGate the other called NandGate. \nNandGates work like AndGates that have a Not attached to the output. \nNorGates work lake OrGates that have a Not attached to the output.\nCreate a series of gates that prove the following equality NOT (( A and B) or (C and D)) is that same as NOT( A and B ) and NOT (C and D). \nMake sure to use some of your new gates in the simulation."
