    "## 5.11. The Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "* We now turn our attention to using a divide and conquer strategy as a way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. \n",
    "* The first algorithm we will study is the merge sort. Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. \n",
    "* If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case).\n",
    "* If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. \n",
    "* Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a merge, is performed. \n",
    "* Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them together into a single, sorted, new list. \n",
    "* Figure 10 shows our familiar example list as it is being split by mergeSort. \n",
    "* Figure 11 shows the simple lists, now sorted, as they are merged back together."

    "* The mergeSort function shown in ActiveCode 1 begins by asking the base case question. \n",
    "* If the length of the list is less than or equal to one, then we already have a sorted list and no more processing is necessary. \n",
    "* If, on the other hand, the length is greater than one, then we use the Python slice operation to extract the left and right halves. \n",
    "* It is important to note that the list may not have an even number of items. \n",
    "* That does not matter, as the lengths will differ by at most one."
