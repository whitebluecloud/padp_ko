    "## 5.9. The Insertion Sort\n",
    "* The insertion sort, although still O(n2), works in a slightly different way. \n",
    "* It always maintains a sorted sublist in the lower positions of the list. \n",
    "* Each new item is then “inserted” back into the previous sublist such that the sorted sublist is one item larger. \n",
    "* Figure 4 shows the insertion sorting process. The shaded items represent the ordered sublists as the algorithm makes each pass."

    "* We begin by assuming that a list with one item (position 0) is already sorted. \n",
    "* On each pass, one for each item 1 through n−1, the current item is checked against those in the already sorted sublist. \n",
    "* As we look back into the already sorted sublist, we shift those items that are greater to the right. \n",
    "* When we reach a smaller item or the end of the sublist, the current item can be inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Figure 5 shows the fifth pass in detail. At this point in the algorithm, a sorted sublist of five items consisting of 17, 26, 54, 77, and 93 exists. \n",
    "* We want to insert 31 back into the already sorted items. \n",
    "* The first comparison against 93 causes 93 to be shifted to the right. \n",
    "* 77 and 54 are also shifted.\n",
    "* When the item 26 is encountered, the shifting process stops and 31 is placed in the open position. \n",
    "* Now we have a sorted sublist of six items."

    "* The implementation of insertionSort (ActiveCode 1) shows that there are again n−1 passes to sort n items. \n",
    "* The iteration starts at position 1 and moves through position n−1, as these are the items that need to be inserted back into the sorted sublists. \n",
    "* Line 8 performs the shift operation that moves a value up one position in the list, making room behind it for the insertion. \n",
    "* Remember that this is not a complete exchange as was performed in the previous algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The maximum number of comparisons for an insertion sort is the sum of the first n−1 integers. \n",
    "* Again, this is O(n2). \n",
    "* However, in the best case, only one comparison needs to be done on each pass. This would be the case for an already sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One note about shifting versus exchanging is also important. \n",
    "* In general, a shift operation requires approximately a third of the processing work of an exchange since only one assignment is performed. \n",
    "* In benchmark studies, insertion sort will show very good performance."
