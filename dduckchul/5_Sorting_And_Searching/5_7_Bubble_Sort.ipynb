    "* The bubble sort makes multiple passes through a list. \n",
    "* It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of order. \n",
    "* Each pass through the list places the next largest value in its proper place. In essence, each item “bubbles” up to the location where it belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Figure 1 shows the first pass of a bubble sort. \n",
    "* The shaded items are being compared to see if they are out of order. \n",
    "* If there are n items in the list, then there are n−1 pairs of items that need to be compared on the first pass. \n",
    "* It is important to note that once the largest value in the list is part of a pair, it will continually be moved along until the pass is complete."

    "* At the start of the second pass, the largest value is now in place. \n",
    "* There are n−1 items left to sort, meaning that there will be n−2 pairs. Since each pass places the next largest value in place, the total number of passes necessary will be n−1. \n",
    "* After completing the n−1 passes, the smallest item must be in the correct position with no further processing required. \n",
    "* ActiveCode 1 shows the complete bubbleSort function. It takes the list as a parameter, and modifies it by exchanging items as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The exchange operation, sometimes called a “swap,” is slightly different in Python than in most other programming languages. \n",
    "* Typically, swapping two elements in a list requires a temporary storage location (an additional memory location). A code fragment such as will exchange the ith and jth items in the list.\n",
    "* Without the temporary storage, one of the values would be overwritten."

    "* A bubble sort can be modified to stop early if it finds that the list has become sorted. \n",
