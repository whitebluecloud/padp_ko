    "## 5.5.4. Analysis of Hashing\n",
    "* We stated earlier that in the best case hashing would provide a O(1), constant time search technique. \n",
    "* However, due to collisions, the number of comparisons is typically not so simple. \n",
    "* Even though a complete analysis of hashing is beyond the scope of this text, we can state some well-known results that approximate the number of comparisons necessary to search for an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most important piece of information we need to analyze the use of a hash table is the load factor, λ. Conceptually, if λ is small, then there is a lower chance of collisions, meaning that items are more likely to be in the slots where they belong. \n",
    "* If λ is large, meaning that the table is filling up, then there are more and more collisions. \n",
    "* This means that collision resolution is more difficult, requiring more comparisons to find an empty slot.\n",
    "* With chaining, increased collisions means an increased number of items on each chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As before, we will have a result for both a successful and an unsuccessful search. \n",
    "* For a successful search using open addressing with linear probing, the average number of comparisons is approximately 12(1+11−λ) and an unsuccessful search gives 12(1+(11−λ)2) If we are using chaining, the average number of comparisons is 1+λ2 for the successful case, and simply λ comparisons if the search is unsuccessful."
