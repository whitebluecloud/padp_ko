    "\n",
    "* Now that we have examined the basic functionality of our tree data structure, it is time to look at some additional usage patterns for trees. \n",
    "* 이제 우리는 트리 데이터 구조의 기본 기능을 살펴 보았고, 트리에서 추가적인 패턴을 살펴 보겠다.\n",
    "* These usage patterns can be divided into the three ways that we access the nodes of the tree. \n",
    "* 아래의 사용 패턴들은 세가지로 나눌수 있는데, 이것은 트리에서 노드를 접근하는 방식이다. \n",
    "* There are three commonly used patterns to visit all the nodes in a tree. \n",
    "* 트리에 있는 노드들을 모두 방문하기 위해서는 일반적으로 세가지 방식을 사용한다.\n",
    "* The difference between these patterns is the order in which each node is visited.\n",
    "* 이런 패턴들 사이의 다른 점은 노드를 방문하는 순서이다.\n",
    "* We call this visitation of the nodes a “traversal.” The three traversals we will look at are called preorder, inorder, and postorder. \n",
    "* 우리는 이런 노드 방문을 순회라고 한다. 세가지 순회 방법은 전위, 중위, 후위라고 한다.\n",
    "* Let’s start out by defining these three traversals more carefully, then look at some examples where these patterns are useful.\n",
    "* 이 세가지 트리 순회방법을 좀더 조심스럽게 정의해 보고, 이런 패턴들이 왜 사용되는지 살펴 볼 것이다.\n",
    "\n",
    "### preorder\n",
    "* In a preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a recursive preorder traversal of the right subtree.\n",
    "* 전위 순회방법은 먼저 루트 노드를 방문하고 재귀적으로 왼쪽 서브트리를 전위로 순회하고, 이어서 오른쪽 서브트리를 순회한다.\n",
    "\n",
    "### inorder\n",
    "* In an inorder traversal, we recursively do an inorder traversal on the left subtree, visit the root node, and finally do a recursive inorder traversal of the right subtree.\n",
    "* 중위 순회 방법은 재귀적으로 중위 순회를 하며 왼쪽 서브트리, 루트노드, 오른쪽 서브트리를 순회하는 방식으로 진행된다. \n",
    "\n",
    "### postorder\n",
    "* In a postorder traversal, we recursively do a postorder traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree followed by a visit to the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let’s look at some examples that illustrate each of these three kinds of traversals. \n",
    "* First let’s look at the preorder traversal. \n",
    "* As an example of a tree to traverse, we will represent this book as a tree. \n",
    "* The book is the root of the tree, and each chapter is a child of the root. \n",
    "* Each section within a chapter is a child of the chapter, and each subsection is a child of its section, and so on. \n",
    "* Figure 5 shows a limited version of a book with only two chapters. \n",
    "* Note that the traversal algorithm works for trees with any number of children, but we will stick with binary trees for now."

    "* Suppose that you wanted to read this book from front to back. \n",
    "* The preorder traversal gives you exactly that ordering. \n",
    "* Starting at the root of the tree (the Book node) we will follow the preorder traversal instructions. \n",
    "* We recursively call preorder on the left child, in this case Chapter1. \n",
    "* We again recursively call preorder on the left child to get to Section 1.1. Since Section 1.1 has no children, we do not make any additional recursive calls. \n",
    "* When we are finished with Section 1.1, we move up the tree to Chapter 1. \n",
    "* At this point we still need to visit the right subtree of Chapter 1, which is Section 1.2. \n",
    "* As before we visit the left subtree, which brings us to Section 1.2.1, then we visit the node for Section 1.2.2. \n",
    "* With Section 1.2 finished, we return to Chapter 1. \n",
    "* Then we return to the Book node and follow the same procedure for Chapter 2.\n",

    "* The code for writing tree traversals is surprisingly elegant, largely because the traversals are written recursively. \n",
    "* Listing 2 shows the Python code for a preorder traversal of a binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may wonder, what is the best way to write an algorithm like preorder traversal?\n",
    "* Should it be a function that simply uses a tree as a data structure, or should it be a method of the tree data structure itself? \n",
    "* Listing 2 shows a version of the preorder traversal written as an external function that takes a binary tree as a parameter. \n",
    "* The external function is particularly elegant because our base case is simply to check if the tree exists. \n",
    "* If the tree parameter is None, then the function returns without taking any action."
