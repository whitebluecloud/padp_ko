    "A more interesting simulation allows us to study the behavior of the printing queue described earlier in this section. Recall that as students send printing tasks to the shared printer, the tasks are placed in a queue to be processed in a first-come first-served manner. Many questions arise with this configuration. The most important of these might be whether the printer is capable of handling a certain amount of work. If it cannot, students will be waiting too long for printing and may miss their next class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following situation in a computer science laboratory. On any average day about 10 students are working in the lab at any given hour. These students typically print up to twice during that time, and the length of these tasks ranges from 1 to 20 pages. The printer in the lab is older, capable of processing 10 pages per minute of draft quality. The printer could be switched to give better quality, but then it would produce only five pages per minute. The slower printing speed could make students wait too long. What page rate should be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could decide by building a simulation that models the laboratory. We will need to construct representations for students, printing tasks, and the printer (Figure 4). As students submit printing tasks, we will add them to a waiting list, a queue of print tasks attached to the printer. When the printer completes a task, it will look at the queue to see if there are any remaining tasks to process. Of interest for us is the average amount of time students will wait for their papers to be printed. This is equal to the average amount of time a task waits in the queue."

    "To model this situation we need to use some probabilities. For example, students may print a paper from 1 to 20 pages in length. If each length from 1 to 20 is equally likely, the actual length for a print task can be simulated by using a random number between 1 and 20 inclusive. This means that there is equal chance of any length from 1 to 20 appearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are 10 students in the lab and each prints twice, then there are 20 print tasks per hour on average. What is the chance that at any given second, a print task is going to be created? The way to answer this is to consider the ratio of tasks to time. Twenty tasks per hour means that on average there will be one task every 180 seconds:\n",

The approach we took was to write a simulation that modeled the printing tasks as random events of various lengths and arrival times.\n",

    "The output above shows that with 5 pages per minute printing, the average waiting time varied from a low of 17 seconds to a high of 376 seconds (about 6 minutes). With a faster printing rate, the low value was 1 second with a high of only 28. In addition, in 8 out of 10 runs at 5 pages per minute there were print tasks still waiting in the queue at the end of the hour.\n",
