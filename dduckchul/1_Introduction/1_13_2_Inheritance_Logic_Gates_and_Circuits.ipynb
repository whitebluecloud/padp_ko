    "Our final section will introduce another important aspect of object-oriented programming. Inheritance is the ability for one class to be related to another class in much the same way that people can be related to one another. Children inherit characteristics from their parents. Similarly, Python child classes can inherit characteristic data and behavior from a parent class. These classes are often referred to as subclasses and superclasses.\n",

    "Figure 8 shows the built-in Python collections and their relationships to one another. We call a relationship structure such as this an inheritance hierarchy. For example, the list is a child of the sequential collection. In this case, we call the list the child and the sequence the parent (or subclass list and superclass sequence). This is often referred to as an IS-A Relationship (the list IS-A sequential collection). This implies that lists inherit important characteristics from sequences, namely the ordering of the underlying data and operations such as concatenation, repetition, and indexing."
